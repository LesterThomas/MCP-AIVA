It comprises APIs,\ndata models, guidelines, scenarios and a Reference Implementation / Compatibility\nToolkit (RI/CTK).\nSupporting exemplars are provided for implementation of resource management\nplatforms using an abstracted and common model covering NFV, SDN, Legacy\nNetworks, Content, Applications, 5G; using a common set of patterns, templates, and\nAPIs.\nHIP explicitly recognizes that there is a very diverse set of deployed resources and\nthat a one-size static design will not work. The solution is a framework toolkit for\ncreating platforms (reusable blocks) that are tailored to specific SP and vendor\ndeployments, whilst simplifying integration through a simple set of integration patterns\n(SOA microservice orientated) and interoperability using TM Forum APIs, RI/CTK\nand code stubs.",

I am more of looking to understand if a customer is nominating that he wants to have a specific number in the quote journey, can we give this with some checks on various aspects like porting required, does the number retained by any other reseller, can it be used for a renumber order and is it within the zone compatibility?Are there any Open APIs to check these?Tr, Srikar#\n\n------------------------------Srikar Babu SriramCGI Info Systems Management Consulting Inc.------------------------------\n\nOriginal Message\n\nOriginal Message:Sent: May 05, 2023 04:27From: Tim SchmitzSubject: Nominated Telephone Number\n\nHi,to validate a telephone number by structure you may can have a look at standard E.164 and this implementation of google.\n\n------------------------------Tim SchmitzDeutsche Telekom AGOriginal Message:Sent: May 04, 2023 04:39From: Srikar Babu SriramSubject: Nominated Telephone Number",

Note that it is permissible to define additional fields in your service definition - the 'number of licenses' here would be analogous to a 'bandwidth' on some other services. You aren't turning up 'n' services, but turning up a single service with 'n' licenses. Hope that helps! ------------------------------ Pieter Eksteen Ciena Corporation Original Message: Sent: Aug 07, 2024 07:42 From: Pacharah Watcharaporn Subject: TMF 640 Service Activation Hi, I'm currently working on a Service Activation domain.
