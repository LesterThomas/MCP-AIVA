The foundational CONTEXTS are used to establish the enterprise's building blocks. These building blocks are fundamental to the Open Digital Framework (ODF) as they define key concepts that are used throughout ODF. The core frameworks that make up the TM Forum ODF, include the Business Process Framework (aka eTOM), the Information Framework (aka as SID), and the Functional Framework (derived from the previous TAM). The key principles provide the rules and guidelines that govern the application of key concepts in the Open Digital Framework. The rules are designed to reflect the values and goals of a digital organization, while providing direction and guidance for decision- making. These principles help to ensure consistency, alignment, and coherence across any architecture that aspires to align with the Open Digital Architecture (ODA). The section on method or methodology establish the processes and techniques that help an enterprise architect leverage the Open Digital Framework. They provide a structured and systematic approach to identify, analyze, design, and communicate the architecture. These methods or methodologies are here to help ensure quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of the target architecture of the organization. Models are the representations and artifacts that help the enterprise architect, design, document and communicate the architecture. In TM Forum, the Master Open Digital Architecture (MODA) is the definitive reference for ODA which provides the context and visualization of the structure, behavior, and relationships of the ODA business objects (architectural elements). Models help to ensure clarity, purpose, completeness and consistency of the architecture as they evolve through a maturation process which improves its reliability for TM Forum members. The adoption of the TM Forum core frameworks has the benefit of providing alignment with key industry standards and common ontology, in support of the enterprise's strategic and business goals. This can help boost both business and technical capabilities. All principles described in this document provide a foundational ground for the development of the enterprise's governance, rules and policies. TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved.

For some terms, multiple definitions are included as in a specific context a term may have a different meaning. Origin: reference to the source(s) of the definition Definitions may be copied straight over, derived or adapted from the mentioned reference source(s). When a term and its definition are included in the ODF glossary, they become as such part of the ODF standard set of documents, without guarantee to align with the evolving source. Specifically, this means: \u2022 For the terms that are ingested from TM Forum documents, the intent is to update the definition in the glossary as the TM Forum document is updated. For the terms that are ingested from non-TM Forum documents, it is not guaranteed that the definition in this glossary will be updated in case the definition in the source is updated. \u2022 \u2022 Terms that are copied, derived or adapted from non-TM Forum sources, will not be updated in case the definition in the source is updated. Context / where used: an indication of the relevance of the term with the TM Forum collaboration program This notion of context will not be maintained in order to follow the lifecycle of the context, e.g., if a document is deprecated and listed within the context field of a term, it is not guaranteed that the glossary will be updated to reflect that status change. The glossary contains terms from EBA, DPRA, ODA and ODF documentation published in Releases 15.0 up to 21.5, as well as some Release 22.0 documents. Terms from the remaining Release 22.0 documents and Release 22.5 will be mined in the next version of the glossary. Some words within the glossary are more significant in the context of ODF. We represent this variation in significance by a word cloud. We hope that this simple representation of the weight we would like to attach to the use of words in this glossary will assist authors creating TM Forum documentation. TM Forum 2022.

ODF aims to align with key industry standards and common ontology, supporting an organization's strategic and business goals. This alignment can enhance both business and technical capabilities.\n\n**Key Components of ODF:**\n\n* **Business Process Framework (eTOM):** Defines the core business processes of a communications service provider (CSP).\n* **Information Framework (SID):** Provides a standardized approach to data modeling and information management. \n* **Functional Framework:** Derived from the previous TAM (Telecommunications Application Map), it focuses on the functional components of a CSP's IT systems.\n\n**Principles and Methodologies:**\n\n* **Principles:** Provide rules and guidelines for applying key concepts within ODF. These principles ensure consistency, alignment, and coherence across the architecture.\n* **Methodologies:** Establish processes and techniques for leveraging ODF. They offer a structured approach to identify, analyze, design, and communicate the architecture.\n\n**Models:**\n\n* **Master Open Digital Architecture (MODA):** Serves as the definitive reference for ODA, providing context and visualization of the structure, behavior, and relationships of ODA business objects. Models ensure clarity, purpose, completeness, and consistency of the architecture.\n\n**Benefits of ODF Adoption:**\n\n* **Alignment with Industry Standards:** ODF aligns with key industry standards, promoting interoperability and collaboration.\n* **Common Ontology:** Provides a common language and understanding across the organization.\n* **Enhanced Business and Technical Capabilities:** Supports strategic and business goals by improving both business and technical capabilities.\n* **Governance Foundation:** Principles provide a foundational basis for developing the organization's governance, rules, and policies.\n\n**Additional Considerations:**\n\n* **Information Framework Limitations:** The Information Framework is not a software class definition, a standalone implementation tool, or a platform, protocol, or software language specification. \n* **Integration with Existing Processes:** To maximize benefits, businesses need to integrate the Information Framework into their existing processes and procedures, particularly those related to IT definition and development. \n",

The foundational CONTEXTS are used to establish the enterprise's building blocks. These building blocks are fundamental to the Open Digital Framework (ODF) as they define key concepts that are used throughout ODF. The core frameworks that make up the TM Forum ODF, include the Business Process Framework (aka eTOM), the Information Framework (aka as SID), and the Functional Framework (derived from the previous TAM). The key principles provide the rules and guidelines that govern the application of key concepts in the Open Digital Framework. The rules are designed to reflect the values and goals of a digital organization, while providing direction and guidance for decision- making. These principles help to ensure consistency, alignment, and coherence across any architecture that aspires to align with the Open Digital Architecture (ODA). The section on method or methodology establish the processes and techniques that help an enterprise architect leverage the Open Digital Framework. They provide a structured and systematic approach to identify, analyze, design, and communicate the architecture. These methods or methodologies are here to help ensure quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of the target architecture of the organization. Models are the representations and artifacts that help the enterprise architect, design, document and communicate the architecture. In TM Forum, the Master Open Digital Architecture (MODA) is the definitive reference for ODA which provides the context and visualization of the structure, behavior, and relationships of the ODA business objects (architectural elements). Models help to ensure clarity, purpose, completeness and consistency of the architecture as they evolve through a maturation process which improves its reliability for TM Forum members. The adoption of the TM Forum core frameworks has the benefit of providing alignment with key industry standards and common ontology, in support of the enterprise's strategic and business goals. This can help boost both business and technical capabilities. All principles described in this document provide a foundational ground for the development of the enterprise's governance, rules and policies. TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved.

For some terms, multiple definitions are included as in a specific context a term may have a different meaning. Origin: reference to the source(s) of the definition Definitions may be copied straight over, derived or adapted from the mentioned reference source(s). When a term and its definition are included in the ODF glossary, they become as such part of the ODF standard set of documents, without guarantee to align with the evolving source. Specifically, this means: \u2022 For the terms that are ingested from TM Forum documents, the intent is to update the definition in the glossary as the TM Forum document is updated. For the terms that are ingested from non-TM Forum documents, it is not guaranteed that the definition in this glossary will be updated in case the definition in the source is updated. \u2022 \u2022 Terms that are copied, derived or adapted from non-TM Forum sources, will not be updated in case the definition in the source is updated. Context / where used: an indication of the relevance of the term with the TM Forum collaboration program This notion of context will not be maintained in order to follow the lifecycle of the context, e.g., if a document is deprecated and listed within the context field of a term, it is not guaranteed that the glossary will be updated to reflect that status change. The glossary contains terms from EBA, DPRA, ODA and ODF documentation published in Releases 15.0 up to 21.5, as well as some Release 22.0 documents. Terms from the remaining Release 22.0 documents and Release 22.5 will be mined in the next version of the glossary. Some words within the glossary are more significant in the context of ODF. We represent this variation in significance by a word cloud. We hope that this simple representation of the weight we would like to attach to the use of words in this glossary will assist authors creating TM Forum documentation. TM Forum 2022.

This can help service-oriented enterprises catalog the elemental building blocks that drive their operations. Where the Business Process Framework (eTOM) provides a frame of reference for processes and the Information Framework (SID) provides a common information model, the Functional Framework gives a frame of reference for telecom automated functionalities. The basic building block of the Functional Framework, a function is characterized by the information it handles and the service it performs. It doesn't carry any context and allows your systems to employ the same function to perform many different activities. The course explains how a standardized function map and taxonomy can help to re-plan and streamline a function portfolio. ",
