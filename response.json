Technical Architecture: TMF Components & APIs\n\ntmforum\n\n### TM Forum OpenAPI Strategy Overview\n\nIn our TM Forum OpenAPI strategy, we embark on a comprehensive approach to enhance the broadband ecosystem. We aim to define context-specialized TMF Open APIs, tailoring them for addressing, appointing, order management, and service assurance, ensuring a nuanced and efficient operation. Simultaneously, we envision a common product model for broadband access, striking a balance between standardisation and provider customization to meet diverse requirements. Emphasizing cohesion, we outline a shared state model, orchestration processes, workflow dynamics, and error handling standards, fostering consistency, and streamlined communication. Crucially, our strategy entails a clear delineation of ownership responsibilities for actions between access and service providers, accompanied by a roadmap of expected next steps, promoting transparent collaboration and operational efficacy.\n\n### Extend TM Forum OpenAPI's to create domain context specific (DCS) broadband content\n\nTo cater to the diverse requirements of each program contributor, we recognized the necessity for a customized approach to API usage. Some contributors required additional features to meet the specific demands of their organizations. Consequently, extending the TMF OPEN APIs emerged as a strategic approach, allowing us to create context-specific broadband content tailored to the expertise of each contributor.The approach we adopted for the extensions involved each contributor sharing their payload on the existing API they utilized. Through collaborative discussions, we refined and finalized the payload required for each API. In cases where additional fields were deemed necessary, we proceeded with extending the current APIs to accommodate these specific needs Among extending the standards within the current scope, our approach for each API involves the following steps: \u2022 Proposing improvements and revisions to the API \u2022 Providing current samples of payloads used by members \u2022 Developing a revised Open API Specification \u2022 Presenting proposed new data model examples to enhance the overall functionality of the API TMF622 Any payload Wholesale broadband payload DOMAIN CONTEXT SPECIALIZATION TMF622 CORE OPEN API CONTEXT-SPECIFIC OPEN API DCS concept example TM Forum 2024.

Technical Architecture: TMF Components & APIs\n\ntmforum\n\n### TM Forum OpenAPI Strategy Overview\n\nIn our TM Forum OpenAPI strategy, we embark on a comprehensive approach to enhance the broadband ecosystem. We aim to define context-specialized TMF Open APIs, tailoring them for addressing, appointing, order management, and service assurance, ensuring a nuanced and efficient operation. Simultaneously, we envision a common product model for broadband access, striking a balance between standardisation and provider customization to meet diverse requirements. Emphasizing cohesion, we outline a shared state model, orchestration processes, workflow dynamics, and error handling standards, fostering consistency, and streamlined communication. Crucially, our strategy entails a clear delineation of ownership responsibilities for actions between access and service providers, accompanied by a roadmap of expected next steps, promoting transparent collaboration and operational efficacy.\n\n### Extend TM Forum OpenAPI's to create domain context specific (DCS) broadband content\n\nTo cater to the diverse requirements of each program contributor, we recognized the necessity for a customized approach to API usage. Some contributors required additional features to meet the specific demands of their organizations. Consequently, extending the TMF OPEN APIs emerged as a strategic approach, allowing us to create context-specific broadband content tailored to the expertise of each contributor.The approach we adopted for the extensions involved each contributor sharing their payload on the existing API they utilized. Through collaborative discussions, we refined and finalized the payload required for each API. In cases where additional fields were deemed necessary, we proceeded with extending the current APIs to accommodate these specific needs Among extending the standards within the current scope, our approach for each API involves the following steps: \u2022 Proposing improvements and revisions to the API \u2022 Providing current samples of payloads used by members \u2022 Developing a revised Open API Specification \u2022 Presenting proposed new data model examples to enhance the overall functionality of the API TMF622 Any payload Wholesale broadband payload DOMAIN CONTEXT SPECIALIZATION TMF622 CORE OPEN API CONTEXT-SPECIFIC OPEN API DCS concept example TM Forum 2024.

We're looking at the business processes and technical engineering (APIs related to the journeys for each business use case). The goal is to standardize and harmonize the solution for a country-agnostic approach by introducing common business scenarios and APIs with a fiber related product payload in a NetCo platform.
