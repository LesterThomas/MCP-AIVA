The foundational CONTEXTS are used to establish the enterprise's building blocks. These building blocks are fundamental to the Open Digital Framework (ODF) as they define key concepts that are used throughout ODF. The core frameworks that make up the TM Forum ODF, include the Business Process Framework (aka eTOM), the Information Framework (aka as SID), and the Functional Framework (derived from the previous TAM). The key principles provide the rules and guidelines that govern the application of key concepts in the Open Digital Framework. The rules are designed to reflect the values and goals of a digital organization, while providing direction and guidance for decision- making. These principles help to ensure consistency, alignment, and coherence across any architecture that aspires to align with the Open Digital Architecture (ODA). The section on method or methodology establish the processes and techniques that help an enterprise architect leverage the Open Digital Framework. They provide a structured and systematic approach to identify, analyze, design, and communicate the architecture. These methods or methodologies are here to help ensure quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of the target architecture of the organization. Models are the representations and artifacts that help the enterprise architect, design, document and communicate the architecture. In TM Forum, the Master Open Digital Architecture (MODA) is the definitive reference for ODA which provides the context and visualization of the structure, behavior, and relationships of the ODA business objects (architectural elements). Models help to ensure clarity, purpose, completeness and consistency of the architecture as they evolve through a maturation process which improves its reliability for TM Forum members. The adoption of the TM Forum core frameworks has the benefit of providing alignment with key industry standards and common ontology, in support of the enterprise's strategic and business goals. This can help boost both business and technical capabilities. All principles described in this document provide a foundational ground for the development of the enterprise's governance, rules and policies. TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved.

Architectural approach and design principles\n\nThe ODA Framework defines an approach to decoupling and separation of concerns which is essential to facilitate rapid independent evolution of solutions, whilst retaining Architectural cohesion, minimizing the complexity and cost of integration, and achieving implementation interoperability for e2e services. The ODA Architecture is captured in eight main artefact groupings which are inspired by TOGAF Enterprise Architecture best practice. Together these groupings provide a comprehensive Architecture for complete service lifecycle automation within an enterprise - such as a Communications Service Provider.TM Forum 2018.

These capabilities cover key aspects of the TOGAF Architecture Development Methodology (ADM) described in Appendix B. Together the ODA Framework artefact groupings deliver agility in managing the zero-touch automation of a service lifecycle - which is a key ODA requirement. The architectural approach to realizing the ODA is achieved through ODA requirements management creating the following ODA Architecture artefact groupings: \u2022 (A) ODA Concepts and Principles - documents the architecture principles, concepts and the requirements that each Architecture Framework grouping must fulfill. \u2022 (B) ODA Architecture Vision Document \u2013 this document - defines the 8 ODA Architecture Framework groupings, provides a definition of the artefacts required in each, such as: specifications, capabilities, best practices including architecture methods/methodologies and metrics, code and tooling. The ODA capabilities to achieve service lifecycle agility are captured in the following artefact groupings: \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 (C) Agile and model driven Management defines the requirements, modelling and tooling approach for ODA lifecycle which is the key to accomplishing business agility.

The foundational CONTEXTS are used to establish the enterprise's building blocks. These building blocks are fundamental to the Open Digital Framework (ODF) as they define key concepts that are used throughout ODF. The core frameworks that make up the TM Forum ODF, include the Business Process Framework (aka eTOM), the Information Framework (aka as SID), and the Functional Framework (derived from the previous TAM). The key principles provide the rules and guidelines that govern the application of key concepts in the Open Digital Framework. The rules are designed to reflect the values and goals of a digital organization, while providing direction and guidance for decision- making. These principles help to ensure consistency, alignment, and coherence across any architecture that aspires to align with the Open Digital Architecture (ODA). The section on method or methodology establish the processes and techniques that help an enterprise architect leverage the Open Digital Framework. They provide a structured and systematic approach to identify, analyze, design, and communicate the architecture. These methods or methodologies are here to help ensure quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of the target architecture of the organization. Models are the representations and artifacts that help the enterprise architect, design, document and communicate the architecture. In TM Forum, the Master Open Digital Architecture (MODA) is the definitive reference for ODA which provides the context and visualization of the structure, behavior, and relationships of the ODA business objects (architectural elements). Models help to ensure clarity, purpose, completeness and consistency of the architecture as they evolve through a maturation process which improves its reliability for TM Forum members. The adoption of the TM Forum core frameworks has the benefit of providing alignment with key industry standards and common ontology, in support of the enterprise's strategic and business goals. This can help boost both business and technical capabilities. All principles described in this document provide a foundational ground for the development of the enterprise's governance, rules and policies. TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved.

Architectural approach and design principles\n\nThe ODA Framework defines an approach to decoupling and separation of concerns which is essential to facilitate rapid independent evolution of solutions, whilst retaining Architectural cohesion, minimizing the complexity and cost of integration, and achieving implementation interoperability for e2e services. The ODA Architecture is captured in eight main artefact groupings which are inspired by TOGAF Enterprise Architecture best practice. Together these groupings provide a comprehensive Architecture for complete service lifecycle automation within an enterprise - such as a Communications Service Provider.TM Forum 2018. All Rights Reserved.Page 14 of 51\n\n# ODA Architecture Vision R18.0.0\n\ntmforum 8 Artefact Groupings that define ODA Framework (A) ODA Concepts & Principles (including GB998 Open Digital Architecture (ODA) Concepts & Principles, etc.) (B) ODA Architecture Vision (including IG1166 Open Digital Architecture Vision R18.0.0, etc.) tmforum (D) ODA Business Architecture Including TMF071 ODA Terminology, etc) (E) ODA Information Systems Architecture ODA-ISA Including IG1167 ODA Functional Architecture (F) ODA Technical Architecture ODA-TA Including IG1171 ODA Component Definition (G) ODA Solutions Implementation Including ODA Component Library tbd (H) ODA Deployment & Runtime Including Virtualization, cloud, PaaS, laaS, tbd (C) ODA Agile & Model Driven Management (Requirements, Life-cycle Model & Tools including Curate Fx) Figure 3: TM Forum Open Digital Architecture Artefact Groupings 017 TM Forum | 1 Each of the core ODA Framework artefact groupings provide capabilities to support the responsibilities of different ODA Architecture users/stakeholders. These capabilities cover key aspects of the TOGAF Architecture Development Methodology (ADM) described in Appendix B. Together the ODA Framework artefact groupings deliver agility in managing the zero-touch automation of a service lifecycle - which is a key ODA requirement. The architectural approach to realizing the ODA is achieved through ODA requirements management creating the following ODA Architecture artefact groupings: \u2022 (A) ODA Concepts and Principles - documents the architecture principles, concepts and the requirements that each Architecture Framework grouping must fulfill. \u2022 (B) ODA Architecture Vision Document \u2013 this document - defines the 8 ODA Architecture Framework groupings, provides a definition of the artefacts required in each, such as: specifications, capabilities, best practices including architecture methods/methodologies and metrics, code and tooling. The ODA capabilities to achieve service lifecycle agility are captured in the following artefact groupings: \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 (C) Agile and model driven Management defines the requirements, modelling and tooling approach for ODA lifecycle which is the key to accomplishing business agility. The methods/methodologies, metrics and tooling described here will be used to manage requirements across all these artefacts to address different stakeholders' needs. (D) ODA Business Architecture, that will describe product and/or service strategy, the organizational, functional, process, information, and geographic aspects of the business environment, based on the business principles, business goals, and strategic drivers (Including common vocabulary, ODA Terminology etc. - Including TMF071 ODA Terminology R18.0.0, etc.) (E) ODA Information Systems Architecture (ISA), which must provide the Functional Architecture (IG1167 ODA Functional Architecture R18.0.0) and concepts of Data and Applications Architecture."

ODF's core frameworks include:\n\n* **Business Process Framework (eTOM):** Defines the standard business processes for communications service providers (CSPs).\n* **Information Framework (SID):** Provides a standardized information model for CSPs, ensuring consistent data representation across systems.\n* **Functional Framework:** Derived from the previous TAM (Telecommunications Application Map), it outlines the functional components and their relationships within a CSP's IT landscape.\n\nODF also establishes key principles that guide the application of these concepts. These principles ensure consistency, alignment, and coherence across architectures that aim to align with the Open Digital Architecture (ODA). Additionally, ODF provides methods and methodologies to help enterprise architects leverage the framework effectively. These methods offer a structured approach to identify, analyze, design, and communicate the architecture.\n\nModels, such as the Master Open Digital Architecture (MODA), serve as representations and artifacts to support the design, documentation, and communication of the architecture. MODA provides a definitive reference for ODA, visualizing the structure, behavior, and relationships of ODA business objects. \n\n**Benefits of Adopting ODF:**\n\n* **Alignment with Industry Standards:** ODF aligns with key industry standards and common ontology, supporting an organization's strategic and business goals.\n* **Enhanced Business and Technical Capabilities:** Adoption of ODF can boost both business and technical capabilities by providing a standardized framework for architecture development.\n* **Governance, Rules, and Policies:** The principles outlined in ODF provide a foundation for developing the organization's governance, rules, and policies.\n\n**ODA Architecture Vision:**\n\nThe ODA Architecture Vision defines eight main artefact groupings that provide a comprehensive architecture for complete service lifecycle automation within an enterprise. These groupings include:\n\n* **ODA Concepts & Principles:** Documents the architectural principles, concepts, and requirements for each ODA Framework grouping.\n* **ODA Architecture Vision:** Defines the eight ODA Architecture Framework groupings and provides a definition of the required artefacts, including specifications, capabilities, best practices, methods/methodologies, metrics, code, and tooling.\n* **Agile and Model Driven Management:** Defines the requirements, modelling, and tooling approach for ODA lifecycle management, enabling business agility.\n* **ODA Business Architecture:** Describes product and/or service strategy, organizational, functional, process, information, and geographic aspects of the business environment.\n* **ODA Information Systems Architecture (ISA):** Provides the Functional Architecture and concepts of Data and Applications Architecture. \n",

By adopting ODA, CSPs can create new and differentiated services that improve productivity, reduce maintenance and integration costs, and enhance customer experience. \n\nODA replaces traditional Operations and Business Support Systems (OSS/BSS) with a new approach that simplifies design, modernizes build, and automates operation. This approach enables CSPs to become more agile, efficient, and customer-centric. \n\n**Key Components of ODA:**\n\n* **Open APIs:** ODA provides a set of standardized Open APIs that enable interoperability and collaboration between CSPs, suppliers, and SIs. These APIs define how different components interact and exchange data, making it easier to build and integrate new services. \n* **ODA Components:** ODA Components are self-describing, deployable software modules that encapsulate specific functionalities. They are built on open standards like Docker and Kubernetes and include Telco-domain knowledge and metadata. This metadata describes the component's core function, notification/reporting, security, and management functions. \n* **ODA Canvas:** The ODA Canvas is a platform that provides a testing environment for ODA Components. It allows developers to test and validate the deployment of components before deploying them in production environments. \n* **Governance:** ODA Governance ensures that solutions adhere to ODA principles throughout the project lifecycle. This includes activities like conformance testing, security assessments, and data governance. \n\n**Benefits of ODA:**\n\n* **Improved Agility:** ODA enables CSPs to respond quickly to market changes and customer demands. \n* **Enhanced Customer Experience:** ODA facilitates the development of innovative services that improve customer satisfaction. \n* **Reduced Costs:** ODA simplifies design, build, and operation, leading to lower maintenance and integration costs. \n* **Increased Efficiency:** ODA automates operations, making CSPs more efficient and productive. \n* **Collaboration and Innovation:** ODA promotes collaboration between CSPs, suppliers, and SIs, fostering innovation and accelerating concept-to-cash. \n\n**Getting Started with ODA:**\n\nTM Forum provides a comprehensive set of resources to help organizations adopt ODA. This includes training and certification programs, interactive learning modules, and support services. Additionally, the ODA interactive map provides access to a vast library of industry-created assets, including the business process framework, design principles, and specifications for standardized components and Open APIs. \n",

The ODA Component concept builds on top of open standards like Docker and Kubernetes, and adds Telco-domain knowledge and meta-data. The starting point for building an ODA component is containerized, micro-service software described in a kubernetes manifest YAML file. To turn this into an ODA Component we will: Add meta-data to the Kubernetes manifest describing the Core Function, Notification/Reporting, Security Function and Management Function of the software component. Add labels to all the standard Kubernetes resources to label them as belonging to the component. Test the deployment of the Component in an operating platform that has the ODA Canvas installed (for example the TM FOrum Open-Digital Lab). See the Getting Started section to see how to install the ODA Canvas onto a kubernetes cluster environmnet. Step 1: ODA-Component Metadata\uf0c1 This guide has been updated to conform to the v1beta2 component specification. The ODA-Component metadata contains all the Telco-domain knowledge that makes the component a self-describing deployable software module. From IG1171 ODA Component Definition, this meta-data describes the Open-APIs, event data schemas as well as security and management & operations for the component. The meta-data is defined using a Kubernetes CustomResourceDefinition. ",

It provides a common language and understanding for architects, stakeholders, and business associates in the telecommunications industry. \n\nODF consists of several core frameworks:\n\n* **Business Process Framework (eTOM):** Defines standard business processes for communications service providers (CSPs).\n* **Information Framework (SID):** Provides a standardized information model for CSPs, ensuring consistent data representation across systems.\n* **Functional Framework:** Outlines the functional components and their relationships within a CSP's IT landscape.\n\nODF also establishes key principles that guide the application of these concepts, ensuring consistency, alignment, and coherence across architectures. It provides methods and methodologies to help enterprise architects leverage the framework effectively. \n\nThe Master Open Digital Architecture (MODA) serves as a representation and artifact to support the design, documentation, and communication of the architecture. MODA provides a definitive reference for ODA, visualizing the structure, behavior, and relationships of ODA business objects. \n\nAdopting ODF offers several benefits:\n\n* **Alignment with Industry Standards:** ODF aligns with key industry standards and common ontology, supporting an organization's strategic and business goals.\n* **Enhanced Business and Technical Capabilities:** Adoption of ODF can boost both business and technical capabilities by providing a standardized framework for architecture development.\n* **Governance, Rules, and Policies:** The principles outlined in ODF provide a foundation for developing the organization's governance, rules, and policies. \n"
